This project, predicts the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. Prediction is done for the cnt column using all of the other columns, except for casual and registered. To accomplish this, few different machine learning models are created and their performance is also evaluated.

Descriptions for the relevant columns:

    instant - A unique sequential ID number for each row
    dteday - The date of the rentals
    season - The season in which the rentals occurred
    yr - The year the rentals occurred
    mnth - The month the rentals occurred
    hr - The hour the rentals occurred
    holiday - Whether or not the day was a holiday
    weekday - The day of the week (as a number, 0 to 7)
    workingday - Whether or not the day was a working day
    weathersit - The weather (as a categorical variable)
    temp - The temperature, on a 0-1 scale
    atemp - The adjusted temperature
    hum - The humidity, on a 0-1 scale
    windspeed - The wind speed, on a 0-1 scale
    casual - The number of casual riders (people who hadn't previously signed up with the bike sharing program)
    registered - The number of registered riders (people who had already signed up)
